* airy 0.1.0

*airy* is a command line Python script to collect [[https://www2.purpleair.com][PurpleAir]] air quality sensor data into a database. 

When run periodically, *airy* can monitor for changes in air quality and send an SMS alert if desired.

* How it works

The following sequence diagram illustrates how *airy* works. 

[[file:doc/images/airy-architecture.png]]

*airy* keeps a database of requests for sensor info in a SQLite3 database named ~airy.db~. Each sensor is uniquely identified by a ~sensorID~. When *airy* is run, it reads the last sensor info for that ~sensorID~ (written from a previous run of *airy*) and requests the most recent data for that same sensor from /PurpleAir/'s servers. *airy* will save the new data and compare it with the previous to determine if an alert should be sent.

* Features

- Command line interface to support automation.
- Storage of /PurpleAir/ sensor readings are stored in [[https://www.sqlite.org/index.html][SQLite]] 3 database.
- SMS alert support to be notified when AQI has gotten worse or better.
   - Requires [[https://www.twilio.com][Twilio]] SMS service with the following info:
       - Account SID
       - Auth Token
       - Twilio Phone Number

* How to use

** Get the ~sensorID~
    1. Open the [[https://www.purpleair.com/map?opt=1/mAQI/a10/cC0#11/37.7703/-122.4407][PurpleAir Map]]
    2. Find a sensor of interest and tap on it to pull up its dialog.
    3. At the bottom of the dialog, tap /Get this Widget/
    4. Tap /JSON/ to open the JSON data of that sensor.
    5. Find the value for the first ~ID~ key in the JSON. That is the ~sensorID~.

** Running on the command line

Call *airy* with the ~sensorID~ as a parameter. For example, to get data for ~sensorID 68949~ run the following command:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ ./airy.py 68949
Airy SensorID: 68949
    Raw PM2.5: 9.96   -10.4%
    EPA PM2.5: 41
 AQ & U PM2.5: 43
      Level 0: Good. Air quality is considered satisfactory.
#+END_SRC

Automating to periodically run this command can enable alerting. 

* Requirements

- Python 3.8
- SQLite 3.31

* TL;DR Installation

In the top level directory ~airy~ execute the following commands:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ make venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ make install-dependencies
#+END_SRC

* Thank Yous

Thanks to /PurpleAir/ for providing the sensor data that makes this script even possible.

Thanks to all the Firefighters working throughout the West Coast.
